# <My Portfolio>

## Description

In this challenge I designed a website showcasing my portfolio.  This is a project that I can use and update throughout my progression as a developer to showcase my skills for future employers and for myself.  I learned a lot about the extensive nature of starting a project from scratch, and how difficult it can be when you get stuck.  This helped me understand areas I need to improve on and practice.

## Credits

I worked with a partner, Nick Rosales, for this project.  Here's a link to his github.
